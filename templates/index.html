        Welcome to the Toxic Comment Detector!

            This tool is designed to help identify and mitigate toxic comments in online interactions.
            With the increasing prevalence of online communication, ensuring respectful and constructive
            dialogue has become more important than ever.

            Toxic comments can include offensive language, threats, hate speech, and other types of 
            harmful content that can negatively impact individuals and communities. Our tool leverages
            advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to 
            detect such comments automatically.

            By detecting toxic comments, this tool aims to foster a safer and more inclusive online 
            environment. Whether you are managing a social media platform, an online forum, or any other
            community space, this tool can assist in maintaining a positive atmosphere.

            Using the Toxic Comment Detector is simple:
          
              1)Enter the comment you want to check in the text box below.

              2)Click the "Test Comment" button.

              3)The model will analyze the comment and provide a result indicating whether it is toxic 
              or non-toxic.

          Feel free to try it out and see how it works!
